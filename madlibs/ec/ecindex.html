                For my visual design citique, I asked two of my fellow deisgn major students to give me their feedback and ideas. One of them is my good classmate Giang. I have taken multipe design classes with her in the past and is current the design lead for an outside project I am working on. What makes their opinions valid is her experience in UI/UX design and the many different web development projects she has worked on. The other design peer I asked was Amy, a design friend outside the class. Her man emphasis in design is graphic and communication design. I find her feedback and opinions helpful because she has a strong eye for visibility and accessibility. I value her opinion because she may have insignts on components that may be harder to read and/or need more focus.

                The main feedback I recieved was correlated to the final output page. Like I had mentioned in my pervious project breif, the page first loads the input fields and after all inputs are filled it loads the output to the right. However, when the output loads, the input setion shifts to the left making the box itself very thin. Viusally, it does not looking clean and descreases the overall functionality. Both suggested instead of using an overlay to use empty divs to transition from input to output. This would mean that when the user finshes inputing information, the input fields disappear and get replaced with the output. This would also require a reload/restart button.

                A huge suggetion that was made was related to the body text and the structure of the input field. Overall, it can be seen as inconsistent from the first look. Some input fields take up one line while others take two. They also end at different points, making the unaligned. A solution to fix this would be to either make them all centred or structure it in a way where the input title sit ontop of the input box.

                They also suggested it would be fun to add sound and other effects. Since it is Star Wars themed, it would be fun to add a lightsaber sound effect when a button is clicked. Another suggestion would be to add background music to add to the theme.
