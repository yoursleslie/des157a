                After reading "“Best Practices for Form Design,”, I was amazed bu how much planning goes into creating forms for users. Something thta can be seen as so simple can tae so mucn thought and planning. There is a great emphasis on clarity, as well design forms guides users through the process smootly. When forms are poorly designed, it can lead to fraustration from the user, leading to abandoment. Explnations on the importance of grouped related feilds were extremly useful.<br>
                <br> Something that stood out to me was how the smallest detais can impact usability. Things like labels, placement and feedback can make or break a form. I have often filled out forms that were over whelming, therefore these tips help me realize the areas these forms can be improved. <br>
                <br> Using these principles, I can apply them to upcoming and future projects. I can use these principals by increasing my atention to detail and be intentional with my language, flow and visuals. Successful design is not always aboyt visuals and appercance, but also focus on the users journey.<br>
