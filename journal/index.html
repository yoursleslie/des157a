               When reading "Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog", author Naema Baskanderi focused on the diagram model and how it's useful to enhance the user experience. Modals are relevant because they are commonly used in modern interfaces and easily can become difficuly is not thought out properly.

               <br>
               When using modals, they should be with intention and when the users full attention is needed. The purpose of the modal should be clear and increase accessibility, meaning it's also simple and focused on content. There shoild also be visible exit objects in order to avoid trapping the user. Modals are made in make the user experience smoother and easier, therefore modals should not block essetial navigation. They should instead be responsive and accessible.

                While reading this article, I was able to gain a better understanding around the idea of modals as a design element and not just a user flow decision. Fo future projects, I hope to be more intuitive when using modals and focus on havining minimal popups and interruptions. I can see how this aligns with UX principals of maintaining the user's control and keeping an emphasis of accessibility.

                After reading “Best Practices for Form Design,”, I was amazed bu how much planning goes into creating forms for users. Something thta can be seen as so simple can tae so mucn thought and planning. There is a great emphasis on clarity, as well design forms guides users through the process smootly. When forms are poorly designed, it can lead to fraustration from the user, leading to abandoment. Explnations on the importance of grouped related feilds were extremly useful.<br>
                <br> Something that stood out to me was how the smallest detais can impact usability. Things like labels, placement and feedback can make or break a form. I have often filled out forms that were over whelming, therefore these tips help me realize the areas these forms can be improved. <br>
                <br> Using these principles, I can apply them to upcoming and future projects. I can use these principals by increasing my atention to detail and be intentional with my language, flow and visuals. Successful design is not always aboyt visuals and appercance, but also focus on the users journey.<br>
